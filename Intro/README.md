## Best Practice

2. Outside links increase authority

[Steps to a Google-friendly site](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/40349?hl=en)

Don't use images to display important names, content, or links. Our crawler doesn't recognize text contained in graphics. Use ALT attributes if the main content and keywords on your page can't be formatted in regular HTML.

## Early Algorithm

Before: repeat keyword, make website copies to rank #1 

**2003**: Search landscape changed dramatically with **Florida, made SEO more complicated**

**2004**: Austin (invisible text, meta-keyword tag with spammy kw)

**2004**: Brandy (semantic indexing; LSI make google understand the page based on pattern; inbound link, neighborhoods links)

2005: Personalized (track user web history, linked to cookies)

2007: Universal (local, related, news, images)

2009: Vince (prefer big brand)

2009: Caffeine (Focused on speed, faster indexing, realtime updates, reduce delays, rewards publishing timely content)
